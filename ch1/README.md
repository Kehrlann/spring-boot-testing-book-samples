# Chapter 1: intro

The projects in this chapter are not designed to be used. They are just here for having some test
classes that are discussed in the book.

## Projects:

- **`maven`** - An empty project, testable with Maven.
- **`gradle`** - An empty project, testable with Gradle.
- **`widget`** - A small project showcasing Spring Boot Tests vs manually wired Spring applications
  (`ManualSpringBootTests` and `SimpleManualSpringBootTests`).
